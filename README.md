# AWS-Online-Medical-Architecture


# Online Medical Services AWS Cloud Solution

## Introduction

This repository documents the deployment of a robust cloud infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the Medical Company, a startup SaaS company revolutionizing the healthcare industry with an innovative online medical social networking and diagnosis assistance application. This platform caters to users across Asia Pacific (APAC), the United States, and Europe, offering seamless online appointments, remote consultations and diagnosis, e-prescription services, and secure payment processing.

## Project Overview

The project aimed to develop a highly available, scalable, and secure cloud platform to support the Medical Company's online medical services. Key AWS services utilized include Amazon EC2 for web application hosting, Amazon RDS with MySQL for data storage, Amazon S3 for file storage, Amazon ElastiCache for performance enhancement, Elastic Load Balancing for traffic distribution, Amazon SNS for internal communication, and Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and maintenance.

## Key Features

- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Leveraging Amazon EC2 in Auto Scaling groups ensures the platform can seamlessly handle spikes in user traffic and data volume.
- **Data Storage and Backup**: Amazon RDS with MySQL and Amazon S3 are used to store and backup critical application data and user-uploaded files securely.
- **Performance Optimization**: Amazon ElastiCache is employed to improve web application performance by caching frequently accessed data.
- **High Availability**: Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances, ensuring high availability and reliability of the platform.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Amazon CloudWatch is utilized for real-time monitoring, alerting, and maintenance of the cloud infrastructure.
- **Security and Compliance**: Access permissions are configured according to AWS best practices, and auditing is implemented to track all user actions for compliance and security purposes.

## Deployment Process

1. **Architecture Design**: The cloud architecture is designed based on the 5 pillars of cloud architecture, ensuring scalability, reliability, security, performance, and cost optimization.
2. **Network Setup**: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with NAT gateway is constructed to interact with users securely, adhering to AWS best practices.
3. **Application Deployment**: The web application is deployed on EC2 instances in Auto Scaling groups, with RDS instances configured for data storage and ElastiCache for performance enhancement.
4. **Traffic Distribution and Monitoring**: Elastic Load Balancing is implemented for traffic distribution, while CloudWatch monitors system health and performance in real-time.
5. **Security and Compliance**: Security best practices are applied to secure sensitive medical information, with auditing configured to track user actions for compliance and security purposes.
